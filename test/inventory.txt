Binary files often don't lend themselves to comments.

noop.ips:
 * The smallest possible valid IPS patch. It consists of the header and the
   footer, with no patch records.
 * The output file should be identical to the input file.

zero_run_length.ips:
 * An IPS file with a valid header and footer. The only record specifies
   a run-length encoding with length zero.
 * I'm not sure whether that should be treated as an error, or as a no-op,
   or even a no-op with an asterisk (the asterisk being, if the offset is
   past the end of the input file, should it get zero-padding?)

alpha-la.ips:
 * A single data patch, 37 bytes into the target file, containing the text
   "LaLiLuLeLo".

empty.txt:
 * An empty file. Not really useful but a good test case to make sure the
   the program doesn't do anything stupid.
