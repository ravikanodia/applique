This is a text file used for testing some patches of various types. There is not
much to say about it, except that it is plain ASCII text, and that every line of
it is exactly 80 characters long. None of that matters from the perspective of a
patch file, but it makes visual inspection of the files easy. Here is probably a
good place to put some big boxes. ASCII art patches could make some use of them.

There are thirty rows of empty space in that box, and seventy-eight columns of a
similar nature. That means the inner space is 30 * 78 = 2100 + 240 = 2340 spaces
in total. Of course, the border adds two rows and two columns, so the true total
is 32 * 80 = 2400 + 160 = 2560 spaces. And of course, before you go using any of
those numbers to create a patch, make sure you are considering the newline which
is after each line of text, meaning each line is REALL 81 characters long. Whew!
