// After the header, an IPS file can have any number of patch records.
// There are two types of specifications. Both start with a 3-byte offset into
// the target file. Then comes a 2-byte size indicator. If the size indicator
// is not zero, then that many bytes of data (starting immediately after the
// size indiactor) should be copied into the target file at the given offset.
// If the size indicator is zero, that signals run-length encoding. The next
// two bytes indicate the length of the run, and the byte after that is the
// data to repeat for the length of the run.
//
// Records do not have a terminator.
// Data Record                |  RLE Record
// offset: 3 bytes            |  offset: 3 bytes
// size: 2 bytes (nonzero)    |  size: 2 bytes (zero)
// data: {size} bytes         |  run:  2 bytes

// A couple of observations:
// * Because the offset size is fixed at 3 bytes (24 bits), IPS patches cannot
//   specify an offset higher than 2^24 - 1. That is to say, they cannot
//   operate on files larger than 2GB.
// * IPS patches can potentially write past the end of the file. This behavior
//   is not explicitly documented as far as I'm aware, but it's definitely used
//   'in the wild' by real patch authors. The spec does not say what to do if
//   there is a gap between the end of the original file and an offset specified
//   by an IPS file. Based on observation of other IPS tools, I believe the
//   correct behavior is to pad the original file with as many zeroes as is
//   necessary to fill the gap. (And luckily it appears that is the default
//   behavior of node's fs module.)
// * The IPS format does not lend itself to streaming the input file off of
//   disk and patching as you parse the IPS file, because there is no
//   requirement for a patch's offset to be greater than the previous one.
// * IPS patches don't have any type of file integrity checks, for either the
//   input or output files. Thus there is no way to know if the file you are
//   patching is the "right" file, and no way to be sure that you've applied
//   the patch correctly except to compare it against a trusted reference.
